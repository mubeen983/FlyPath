# ✈️ FLYPATH: OPTIMIZED FLIGHT ROUTE FINDER💱

## 📋 Overview

This Java-based **Flight Booking System** enables users to search for flights between two cities and choose their preferred flight mode (cheapest or shortest). The system also integrates **currency conversion** to convert flight prices from **EUR to PKR** using an external API.

The system interacts with flight data through an API, validates user input, and recommends flights based on user preferences. It also includes classes that load airport and airline data from CSV files to make the experience more dynamic.
